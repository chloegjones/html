I designed this website by connecting to an AWS EC2 server, uploading documents to the server via FileZilla, and editing them with Brackets. 
This website utilizes:
<ul>
  <li>MySQLWorkbench, PHP, GET, and POST to create login page and upload images/soundcloud to website pages</li>
  <li>JQueryUI to create a "draggable" effect</li>
  <li>JavaScript is used for clicking the login button and displaying incorrect username/pass</li>
