I designed this website by connecting to an AWS EC2 server, uploading documents to the server via FileZilla, and editing them with Brackets. 
This website utilizes:
<ul>
  <li>MySQLWorkbench, PHP, GET, and POST to create login page and upload images/soundcloud to website pages</li>
  <li>JQueryUI to create a "draggable" effect</li>
  <li>JavaScript is used for clicking the login button and displaying incorrect username/pass</li>
</ul>

This website is a resume that showcases my coding skills.
This website utilizes:
<ul>
  <li>Animation in Cgjnd7Columns.html</li>
  <li>Bootstrap tables in Cgjnd7TablesS20.html</li>
  <li>Forms and JS in Cgjnd7ToDoListS20.html</li>
  <li>PHP (GET and POST) and JQuery on the PHP Functions page (in Lectures folder)</li>
